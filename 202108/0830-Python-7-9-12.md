**7. Reverse Integer (Easy)**

Given a signed 32-bit **integer** `x`, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range \[-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

**Example 1**

> Input: x = 123
> Output: 321

**Example 2**

> Input: x = -123
> Output: -321

**Example 3**

> Input: x = 120
> Output: 21

**Constraints**

- `2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x >= 0:
            if int(str(x)[::-1]) < 2**31 - 1:
                return int(str(x)[::-1])
            else: 
                return 0
        else:
            if -int(str(-x)[::-1]) > - 2**31:
                return -int(str(-x)[::-1])
            else:
                return 0
```

**Notes**

- Hint: `int(str(x)[::-1])` 
- Take `string`s as a sequence of elements that you can access by their index

**9. Palindrome Number (Easy, 回文数)**

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.

**Example 1**

> Input: x = 121
> Output: true

**Example 2**

> Input: x = -121
> Output: false
> Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3**

> Input: x = 10
> Output: false
> Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 4:

> Input: x = -101
> Output: false

**Constraints**

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x > - 2**31 and x < 2**31 -1:
            y = str(x)[::-1]
            if str(x) == y:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return False
```

**Notes**

- The key point is the same as the previous question: `str(integer)[::-1]` will reverse the string. Like the function `reverse(list)`, but for a string.


**12. Integer to Roman (Medium)**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D and M`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51500878/131412259-46fbb4a8-bd9a-428f-be55-396bb6ebe22c.png)

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

> Input: num = 3
> Output: "III"

**Example 2:**

> Input: num = 4
> Output: "IV"

**Example 3:**

> Input: num = 9
> Output: "IX"

**Example 4:**

> Input: num = 58
> Output: "LVIII"
> Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

**Example 5:**

> Input: num = 1994
> Output: "MCMXCIV"
> Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

**Constraints**

- `1 <= num <= 3999`

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        
        def f(q, one, five, ten):
            if q == 9: return one+ten;
            if q >= 5: return five+(q-5)*one;
            if q == 4: return one+five;
            else: return q*one
            
        rom = ''
        q, num = divmod(num, 1000)
        rom += q*'M'
        q, num = divmod(num, 100)
        rom += f(q, 'C', 'D', 'M')
        q, num = divmod(num, 10)
        rom += f(q, 'X', 'L', 'C')
        q, num = divmod(num, 1)
        rom += f(q, 'I', 'V', 'X')
        
        return rom
        
```

**Notes**

- `divmod(x, y)` return a tuple consisting of their quotient and remainder
- The first method is the most understandable one. Because for an integer, each numeral stands for a Roman numeral. The nested function is to define how to format a single number, and the next step will be: concatenate those Roman numerals together. Also because of the characteristic of strings, we could use `+=` directly.
