Write an SQL query to swap all `'f'` and `'m'` values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temp table(s).

Note that you **must** write a single update statement, **DO NOT** write any select statement for this problem.

The query result format is in the following example:

**Example1**

**Solutions**

```sql
Update salary
set
    sex = case sex 
               when 'm' then 'f'
               else 'm'
          end;
```

**Notes**
- ```
   UPDATE table_name
   SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
   WHERE condition;
  ```

Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column **for each month**.

The query result format is in the following example:

**Solutions**

```sql
SELECT id,
        Jan as Jan_Revenue,
        Feb as Feb_Revenue,
        Mar as Mar_Revenue,
        Apr as Apr_Revenue,
        May as May_Revenue,
        Jun as Jun_Revenue,
        Jul as Jul_Revenue,
        Aug as Aug_Revenue,
        Sep as Sep_Revenue,
        Oct as Oct_Revenue,
        Nov as Nov_Revenue,
        Dec as Dec_Revenue
FROM Department

PIVOT(
    SUM(revenue)
    FOR month IN (Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)
     ) as pivot_table
```

**Notes**
- ```
    SELECT <non-pivoted column>,  
    [first pivoted column] AS <column name>,  
    [second pivoted column] AS <column name>,  
    ...  
    [last pivoted column] AS <column name>  
    FROM  
    (<SELECT query that produces the data>)   
    AS <alias for the source query>  
    
    PIVOT  
    (  
    <aggregation function>(<column being aggregated>)  
    FOR   
    [<column that contains the values that will become column headers>]   
    IN ( [first pivoted column], [second pivoted column],  
    ... [last pivoted column])  
    )     AS <alias for the pivot table>  
    <optional ORDER BY clause>;  
  ```
