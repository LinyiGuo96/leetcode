**620. Not Boring Movies (easy)**

Table: `Cinema`

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table in **descending** order by `rating`.

The query result format is in the following example:

**Solutions**

```sql
select * 
from cinema
where id%2 = 1 and description != "boring"
order by rating desc;
```

**Notes**

- `%` could be replaced by `mod(id, 2)`

**262. Trips and Users**

Table: `Trips`

Table: `Users`

_Note: the `Status` in the above pic should be `Banned`._

Write a SQL query to find the **cancellation rate** of requests with unbanned users (**both client and driver must not be banned**) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03".

The **cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round Cancellation Rate to **two decimal** points.

The query result format is in the following example:

**Solutions**

```sql
select t.request_at as `Day`, 
       round(sum(if(t.status='completed', 0, 1))/count(t.status), 2) as `Cancellation Rate`
from trips as t
where 
    t.client_id not in (select users_id from users where banned = "Yes") 
and t.driver_id not in (select users_id from users where banned = "Yes")
and t.request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by t.request_at
```

```sql
SELECT T.request_at AS `Day`, 
	ROUND(SUM(IF(T.STATUS = 'completed',0,1))/COUNT(T.STATUS),2) AS `Cancellation Rate`
FROM Trips AS T
JOIN Users AS U1 ON (T.client_id = U1.users_id AND U1.banned ='No')
JOIN Users AS U2 ON (T.driver_id = U2.users_id AND U2.banned ='No')
WHERE T.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY T.request_at
```

**Notes**

- The first method is the most obvious and the easiest one that I can think about, but the result turns out it's too slow, which also seems to be obvious, because I traversed the `users` dataset twice. The idea is pretty simple: remove those records whose `ID` is in the blacklist.
- About `Alias`, remember `To assign an alias to a column, you use the AS keyword followed by the alias. If the alias contains spaces, you must quote it.`
- The second one is the improved version, but it seems that there is something wrong with it.
