Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table in **descending** order by `rating`.

The query result format is in the following example:

**Solutions**

```sql
select * 
from cinema
where id%2 = 1 and description != "boring"
order by rating desc;
```

**Notes**

- `%` could be replaced by `mod(id, 2)`

Write a SQL query to find the **cancellation rate** of requests with unbanned users (**both client and driver must not be banned**) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03".

The **cancellation rate** is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round Cancellation Rate to **two decimal** points.

The query result format is in the following example:
