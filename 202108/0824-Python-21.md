**21. Merge Two Sorted Lists**

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example 1**

> **Input:** l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
> **Output:** [1,1,2,3,4,4]

**Example 2**

> **Input:** l1=[], l2=[]
> **Output:** []

** Example 3**

> **Input:** l1 = [], l2 = [0]
> **Output:** [0]

**Constraints**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order

**Solutions**

```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                cur.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                cur.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            cur = cur.next
        cur.next = l1 or l2
    return dummy.next
```

**Notes**

- To solve this problem, we need to understand the `ListNode`(linked list) at first. Here is a useful [link](https://stackabuse.com/python-linked-lists/).
- You'd better understand the definition the usage of `pointer` (_at least I am not familiar with it_).
- The second method (**Chinese**) explains the above code fair well, click [here](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/solution/he-bing-liang-ge-you-xu-lian-biao-by-leetcode-solu/).
