**601. Human Traffic of Stadium (Hard)**

Table: `Stadium`

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with **consecutive** `id`'s, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in **ascending** order.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1**

**Solutions**

```sql
select distinct t1.*
from stadium t1, stadium t2, stadium t3
where t1.people >= 100 and t2.people >= 100 and t3.people >= 100 and (
    (t1.id-t2.id=1 and t1.id-t3.id=2 and t2.id-t3.id=1) OR    -- t1, t2, t3
    (t2.id-t1.id=1 and t2.id-t3.id=2 and t1.id-t3.id=1) OR    -- t2, t1, t3
    (t3.id-t1.id=2 and t3.id-t2.id=1 and t2.id-t1.id=1)       -- t3, t2, t1
)
order by t1.id;
```

**Notes**

- `--` also comments a line, like `#`
- The key point of the code chunk below is the position of the `t1.id`. Because we want to select those consecutive (>=3) IDs, any satisfying ID could be the first/second/third one
```
    (t1.id-t2.id=1 and t1.id-t3.id=2 and t2.id-t3.id=1) OR    -- t1, t2, t3
    (t2.id-t1.id=1 and t2.id-t3.id=2 and t1.id-t3.id=1) OR    -- t2, t1, t3
    (t3.id-t1.id=2 and t3.id-t2.id=1 and t2.id-t1.id=1)       -- t3, t2, t1
```
- We don't need to consider those consecutive >= 4 IDs senario, because those ID **MUST** satisfy the consecutive three senario!


**626. Exchange Seats**

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' **names** and their corresponding seat **ids**.

The column id is continuous increment.

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

_Note_

If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

**Solutions**

```sql
select (case when mod(id, 2) = 1 and id != (select count(id) from seat) then id+1
             when mod(id,2)=0 then id-1
             else id
        end) as id, student
from seat
order by 1;
```

**Notes**

- `order by 1` means order by the first variable in the `select` statement
- ```CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
    END;```
