Write a function f(n) that takes argument n and returns the nâ€™th Fibonacci number.
You can assume that f(0)=0 and f(1)=1.

```python
def f(n):
    if n = 0:
      return 0
    if n = 1:
      return 1
    a = 0
    b = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
      c = a + b
      a = b
      b = c
    return c
```

```python
def f(n):
    if n = 0:
      return 0
    if n = 1:
      return 1
    
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)
```

You have a flowerbed represented by an array of 0 (spot in flowerbed not occupied) and 1 (spot in flowerbed occupied).
Given n new flowers, can you plant them without having two flowers side by side?
 
 
Example 1:
    Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
    Output: true  
    Explanation [1,0,1,0,1] is a good planting configuration
 
Example 2:
    Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
    Output: false  
    Explanation wherever you plant the 2 flowers, two will be side by side
    For example, [1,1,0,1,1], [1,1,1,0,1], etc

```python
def f(fb, n):
  
```


Write a query that prints out prime numbers between 1 and 100 without using for loops or defining functions.

```sql
select distinct a.num
from input a, input b
group by a.num
having a.num > b.num and a.num % b.num != 0;
```
