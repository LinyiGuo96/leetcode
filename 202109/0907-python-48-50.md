**48. Rotate Image (medium)**

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation**.

**Example 1**

**Example 2**

**Example 3**

> Input: matrix = \[\[1]]
> 
> Output: \[\[1]]

**Example 4**

> Input: matrix = \[\[1,2],\[3,4]]
> 
> Output: \[\[3,1],\[4,2]]

**Constraints**

- matrix.length == n
- matrix[i].length == n
- 1 <= n <= 20
- -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix)
        for i in range(0, n//2):
            for j in range(i, n-i-1):
                t1, t2, t3, t4 = matrix[i][j], matrix[j][n-1-i], matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j], matrix[n-1-j][i]
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][n-1-i], matrix[n-1-i][n-1-j], matrix[n-1-j][i] = t4, t1, t2, t3
```

**Notes**

- Congrats to myself! This is the first time I solved a medium problem totally by myself!
- The key idea is to figure out how to use math formula to represent the rotation pattern
- Because we rotate it by 90 degrees, we could devide the n by n matrix to 4 identical area (half close half open) and for every point in a area, there are another 3 points in rest areas. Mathematically speaking,
> M[i,j] -> M[j, n-1-i] -> M[n-1-i, n-1-j] -> M[n-1-j, i] 
- Here is an illustration plot:

**50. Pow(x, n)**

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., `x^n`).

**Example 1**

> Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
> 
> Output: 1024.00000

**Example 2**

> Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
> 
> Output: 9.26100


**Example 3**

> Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
>
> Output: 0.25000
> 
> Explanation: 2-2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

**Constraints**

- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- -2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1
- -10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4

**Solutions**

```python
# Recursive
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if not n:
            return 1
        if n < 0:
            return 1/self.myPow(x, -n)
        if n % 2:
            return x * self.myPow(x, n-1)
        return self.myPow(x*x, n/2)
```

```python

```

**Notes**

- Again, I could use my method to solve this problem, but it exceeds the time limit, which means it's not a GOOD method. I really can not ignore these two method above, they are so clever!
- The first one is recursive, like you could find, we mainly need to consider three cases: `n=0, n<0, n>0`
    - when n = 0, the result is 0
    - when n < 0, switch it to n > 0
    - when n > 0:
        -  doesn
