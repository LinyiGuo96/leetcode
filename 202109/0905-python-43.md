**43. Multiply Strings**

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

**Example 1**

> Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"  
> Output: "6"  

**Example 2**

> Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"  
> Output: "56088"  

**Constraints**

- 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
- num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
- Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Solutions**

```python

```

**Notes**

- To avoid using `int()`, one feasible way is to use the unicode function, check [`ord()`](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/ord). 
- Unicode is an abstract encoding standard, not an encoding. Thatâ€™s where UTF-8 and other encoding schemes come into play. The Unicode standard (a map of characters to code points) defines several different encodings from its single character set.
- UTF-8 as well as its lesser-used cousins, UTF-16 and UTF-32, are encoding formats for representing Unicode characters as binary data of one or more bytes per character.
- `5/2=2.5` `5//2=2`
- `strip()`, `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` remove all/leading/rear blanks(or other specific string such as `-`, `/`, `0` etc.)
- The `map()` function executes a specified function for each item in an iterable. The item is sent to the function as a parameter,
