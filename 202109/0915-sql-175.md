**175. Combine Two Tables**

**Solution**

```sql
select a.FirstName, a.LastName, b.City, b.State 
from Person as a 
left join Address as b
on a.PersonId = b.PersonId
```

**176. Second Highest Salary**

**Solution**

```sql
select (select distinct Salary
          from Employee
          order by Salary DESC
          limit 1 offset 1) as SecondHighestSalary
```

**Note**

- To retrieve a portion of rows returned by a query, you use the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses.
```sql
SELECT 
    column_list
FROM
    table1
ORDER BY column_list
LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset;
```
  - The `row_count` determines the number of rows that will be returned.
  - The `OFFSET` clause skips the `offset` rows before beginning to return the rows. The `OFFSET` clause is _optional_ so you can skip it. If you use both `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses the `OFFSET` skips `offset` rows first before the `LIMIT` constrains the number of rows.
- To order by variable in `descending`, put `DESC` **behind** the targeting variable

**177. Nth Highest Salary**

**Solution**

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT      # Define the function
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT;                                              #declaration_section
SET M = N-1;                                                #declaration_section
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.             # executable_section
      select distinct salary                                # executable_section
      from Employee                                         # executable_section
      order by Salary DESC                                  # executable_section
      limit M, 1                                            # executable_section
  );
END
```

**Note**

- Still with `limit` in Mysql, `LIMIT [offset,] row_count;` is another way to express the line `LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset;` in the previous question
- The syntax to create a function in Mysql is 
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name [ (parameter datatype [, parameter datatype]) ]
RETURNS return_datatype

BEGIN

   declaration_section

   executable_section

END;
```

**178. Rank Scores**

**Important Note**: For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example `Rank`.

**Solution**

```sql
select a.Score, count(b.Score) as 'Rank'
from Scores a,  (select distinct score from Scores) b
where a.score <= b.Score
group by a.id
order by a.score DESC
```

**Note**

- Because `Rank` is a keyword in MYSQL, to use it as a keyword, add `''` outside of the variable
- When `select ... from table1, table2`, this will put all rows in table2 to each row of table1, like a _cross product_

**180. Consecutive Numbers**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51500878/133530894-8c2290ee-9bf7-4995-8cb9-c4f87fadff07.png)

**Solution**

```sql
select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums 
from logs a, logs b, logs c
where a.id-b.id =1 and b.id - c.id =1 and a.num=b.num and b.num=c.num
```

**Note**

- `CASE...WHEN...`: The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;
```
- The method above will **fail** if there is any gap between two adjacent IDs.

**196. Delete Duplicate Emails**

**Solution**

```sql
delete p1 from person p1, person p2
where p1.email = p2.email and p1.id > p2.id
```

**Note**

- `Delete`: Delete Data From a MySQL Table Using MySQLi and PDO.

Simple use:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column = some_value
```

Eg, delete the first 10 customers:

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
ORDER BY customerName
LIMIT 10;
```

In this question, we see we add `p1` after `delete`, so the output would be the result after removing the selected rows from p1.
