**60. Permutation Sequence**

The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.

**Example 1**

> Input: n = 3, k = 3
> 
> Output: "213"

**Example 2**

> Input: n = 4, k = 9
> 
> Output: "2314"

**Example 3**

> Input: n = 3, k = 1
> 
> Output: "123"

**Constraints**

- 1 <= n <= 9
- 1 <= k <= n!

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        s = []
        
        l = []
        f = 1
        F = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            l.append(str(i)) 
            f *= i
            F.append(f)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            q = (k-1) // F[-i-1]
            s += l[q]
            l.pop(q)
            k -= q * F[-i-1]
            
        return ''.join(s+l)
```


**Notes**

- `list.pop(x)` return and remove the corresponding indexed element in the list
- `''.join(list)` could used to concatenate all elements in a list into a string
- Congrats for myself! This is the first time that I figured out a `hard` python question by myself.
- The first `for` loop is to create listing \['0', '1', '2', ... 'n'] and the factorial list from `1!` to `n!` as `F` (I found I could use `math.factorial(n)` after submitting)
- The second loop is important: 
  - `q = (k-1) // F[-i-1]`  computes the digit's corresponding index in the rest list `l` (notice at each step we pop up one digit from the list)
  - `s += l[q]` add the digit to our result list `s`
  - `l.pop(q)` pop up the digit that we just added to our result (because we won't need it anymore!)
  - `k -= q * F[-i-1]` substract the times we used to find this digit
