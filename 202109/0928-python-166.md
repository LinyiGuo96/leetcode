**166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal (medium)**

_I guess this is still a bad question since there are many ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51500878/135193853-9774ed28-4422-4bf8-b6a7-ca25891b66d9.png)_

Given two integers representing the `numerator` and `denominator` of a fraction, return _the fraction in string format_.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

If multiple answers are possible, return any of them.

It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than 10^4 for all the given inputs.
