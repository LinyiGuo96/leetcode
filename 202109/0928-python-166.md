**166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal (medium)**

_I guess this is still a bad question since there are many ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51500878/135193853-9774ed28-4422-4bf8-b6a7-ca25891b66d9.png)_

Given two integers representing the `numerator` and `denominator` of a fraction, return _the fraction in string format_.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

If multiple answers are possible, return any of them.

It is guaranteed that the length of the answer string is less than 10^4 for all the given inputs.

**Constraints**

- -2^31 <= numerator, denominator <= 2^31 - 1
- denominator != 0

**Solutions**

```python
# from someone better than me
class Solution:
    def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator: int, denominator: int) -> str:
        n, remainder = divmod(abs(numerator), abs(denominator))
        sign = '-' if numerator * denominator < 0 else ''
        result = [sign+str(n), '.']
        stack = []
        
        while remainder not in stack:
            stack.append(remainder)
            n, remainder = divmod(remainder*10, abs(denominator))
            result.append(str(n)) # don't forget the str()
            
        idx = stack.index(remainder)
        result.insert(idx+2, '(') # we need to add 2 here because the result have 2 items at beginning  `result = [sign+str(n), '.']`
        result.append(')')
        
        return ''.join(result).replace('(0)', '').rstrip('.') # in case the quotient is an integer
```
```python
# improved version

# Use a dictionary, not a stack, to avoid an O(n) lookup time for remainder not in stack. The dictionary maps the remainder to its index in the list.
# Bail out of the while loop if remainder is zero. That way, you don't need to worry about deleting a (0) at the end.

def fractionToDecimal(self, numerator, denominator):

    n, remainder = divmod(abs(numerator), abs(denominator))
    sign = '-' if numerator*denominator < 0 else ''
    result = [sign+str(n), '.']
    remainders = {}

    while remainder > 0 and remainder not in remainders:
        remainders[remainder] = len(result)
        n, remainder = divmod(remainder*10, abs(denominator))
        result.append(str(n))

    if remainder in remainders:
        idx = remainders[remainder]
        result.insert(idx, '(')
        result.append(')')

    return ''.join(result).rstrip(".")
```
**Notes**

- Let's think about what will happen here: 
  - the decimal part is not repeating, GOOD!
  - the decimal part is repeating, then 
    - the repeating part could have different lengths
    - the repeating part may happen at different decimal places

So our main problem is **how to find the repeating part, ie, since where the repeating begins and how long it is?**

- Look at the first method. The idea is to repeat deviding the remainder with the denominator until we have a repeated remainder.
