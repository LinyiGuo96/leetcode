**62. Unique Paths**

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Example 1**

**Example 2**

**Example 3**

> Input: m = 7, n = 3
> 
> Output: 28

**Example 4**

> Input: m = 3, n = 3
> 
> Output: 6

**Constraints**

- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

**Solutions**

```python
# My code
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        s = m + n - 2
        return int(math.factorial(s)/(math.factorial(m-1)*math.factorial(n-1)))
```

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[j] = dp[j - 1] + dp[j]
        return dp[-1]
```

**Notes**

- Don't require too much programming skills, mainly about math, not hard. The key idea of my method is: for a `m by n` matrix, we totally need to move `m+n-2` times, and at each side we need to move `m-1` and `n-1` times, so this problem now becomes a _permutation and combination_ problem
- The second method is from someone else, but it doesn't require much mathematics and is more programming:
