**62. Unique Paths**

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Example 3**

> Input: m = 7, n = 3
> 
> Output: 28

**Example 4**

> Input: m = 3, n = 3
> 
> Output: 6

**Constraints**

- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

**Solutions**
