**96. Unique Binary Search Trees (Medium)**

Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique **BST**'s (_binary search trees_) which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`.

**Example 1**

**Example 2**

> Input: n = 1  
> Output: 1

**Constraints**

- 1 <= n <= 19

**Solutions**

```python
# Dynamic Programming
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = [0] * (n+1)
        res[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(i):
                res[i] += res[j] * res[i-1-j]
        return res[n]
```

```python
# Catalan Number
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n):
        return factorial(2*n)//factorial(n)//factorial(n)//(n+1)
```

**Notes**

- This is still a question about dynamic programming (DP), although I don't know the details about it.
- This one could also be solved by using [Catalan Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number) directly.
- The first method I think I would first skip for now, I have thought about it for a while but it's not that intuitive to me.
