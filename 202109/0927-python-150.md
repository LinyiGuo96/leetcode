**150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Valid operators are `+, -, *, and /`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

**Example 1**

> Input: tokens = \["2","1","+","3","\*"]
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

**Example 2**

> Input: tokens = \["4","13","5","/","+"]
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

**Example 3**

> Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]  
> Output: 22  
> Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5  
> = ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5  
> = ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5  
> = ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5  
> = (0 + 17) + 5  
> = 17 + 5  
> = 22  

**Constraints**

- 1 <= tokens.length <= 104  
- tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "\*", or "/", or an integer in the range \[-200, 200].  

**Solutions**

**Notes**

- I just found an interesting things in Python: 

```python
round(2.5) # 2
round(2.51) # 3
round(3.5) # 4
```

Here is the rule for round-off: for a digit `a.bcd`, say round to 1 digits
- if c < 5, then `a.b`
- if c > 5, then `a.(b+1)`
- if c = 5:
  - if d exist, then `a.(b+1)`
  - if d doesn't exist: 
     - if b is even, then `a.b`
     - if b is odd, then `a.(b+1)`
