**67. Add Binary (easy)**

Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.


**Example 1**

> Input: a = "11", b = "1"
>
> Output: "100"

**Example 2**

> Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
> 
> Output: "10101"

**Constraints**

- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
- a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

**Solutions**

```python
# first method

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        x, y = int(a), int(b)
        z = x + y
        if z == 0:
            return "0"
        
        l = [int(i) for i in str(z)]
        res = []
        q = 0
        
        for i in l[::-1]:
            i += q
            q, r = divmod(i, 2)
            res.append(str(r))
        
        res.append(str(q))
        res = ''.join(res)
        res = res[::-1].lstrip("0")
        
        return res
```

```python
# second method

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        carry = 0
        result = ''

        a = list(a)
        b = list(b)

        while a or b or carry:
            if a:
                carry += int(a.pop())
            if b:
                carry += int(b.pop())

            result += str(carry %2)
            carry //= 2

        return result[::-1]
```

**Notes**

- The `divmod()` method takes two numbers and returns a pair of numbers (a tuple) consisting of their quotient and remainder.
- The `reverse()` method reverses the elements of the list and write it back to the list;  `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` for leading and rear!
- The `pop(pos)` method removes the element at the specified position. `pos`: optional, a number specifying the position of the element you want to remove, default value is -1, which returns the last item.

**69. Sqrt(x) (easy)**

Given a _non-negative integer_ `x`, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only the **integer** part of the result is returned.

**Note**: You are _NOT_ allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

**Example 1**

> Input: x = 4
> 
> Output: 2

**Example 2**

> Input: x = 8
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

**Constraints**

- 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        r = x
        while r*r > x:
            r = (r + x/r) // 2
        return int(r)   
```

**Notes**

- [Using only integer division for the Newton method works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_square_root#Using_only_integer_division)
- BTW, I have to say this person [Stefan Pochmann](https://leetcode.com/StefanPochmann/)'s method is very brilliant!

**70. Climbing Stairs (easy)**

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1**

> Input: n = 2  
> Output: 2  
> Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.  
> 1. 1 step + 1 step  
> 2. 2 steps  

**Example 2**

> Input: n = 3  
> Output: 3  
> Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.  
> 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step  
> 2. 1 step + 2 steps  
> 3. 2 steps + 1 step  

**Constraints**

- 1 <= n <= 45

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        s = 0
        x, y = divmod(n, 2)
        for i in range(0, x+1):
            n1 = i*2 + y
            n2 = x-i
            s += (factorial(n1+n2) / (factorial(n1) * factorial(n2)))
        return int(s)
```

**Notes**

- This question could be still viewed as a combination and permutation problem: suppose we have `n1` 1s and `n2` 2s, then # of their combination is `(n1+n2)!/(n1! * n2!)`
