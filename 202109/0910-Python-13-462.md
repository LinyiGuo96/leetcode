**13. Roman to Integer (Easy)**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D and M`.

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1**

> Input: s = "III"
> Output: 3

**Example 2**

> Input: s = "LVIII"
> Output: 58
> Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Constraints**

- 1 <= s.length <= 15
- s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range \[1, 3999].

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        dic = { "I": 1,
                "V": 5,
                "X": 10,
                "L": 50,
                "C": 100,
                "D": 500,
                "M": 1000}
        
        s = s.replace("IV", "IIII")
        s = s.replace("IX", "VIIII")
        s = s.replace("XL", "XXXX")
        s = s.replace("XC", "LXXXX")
        s = s.replace("CD", "CCCC")
        s = s.replace("CM", "DCCCC")
        
        # s = s.replace("IV", "IIII").replace("IX", "VIIII")
        # s = s.replace("XL", "XXXX").replace("XC", "LXXXX")
        # s = s.replace("CD", "CCCC").replace("CM", "DCCCC")
        
        tol = 0
        for i in s:
            tol += dic[i]
        
        return tol
```

**Notes**

- Switch the special order and then replace each Roman numeral with real numbers.

**462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II**

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return _the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal_.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by `1`.

Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a `32-bit` integer.

**Example 1**

> Input: nums = [1,2,3]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:
> Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
> \[1,2,3]  =>  \[2,2,3]  =>  \[2,2,2]

**Example 2**

> Input: nums = [1,10,2,9]
> Output: 16

**Constraints**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        median = sorted(nums)[int(len(nums) / 2)]
        return sum(abs(num - median) for num in nums)
```

**Notes**

- The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations (the â„“1 norm) [Link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/113270/the-median-minimizes-the-sum-of-absolute-deviations-the-ell-1-norm)
- Remember that `sorted()` function won't change the data itself, but `list.sort()` will.
