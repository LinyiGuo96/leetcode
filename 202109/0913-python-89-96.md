**89. Gray Code (Medium)**

An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of 2n integers where:

- Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2^n - 1]`,  
- The first integer is 0,  
- An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,  
- The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit,   
- The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.  

Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

**Example 1**

> Input: n = 2  
> Output: [0,1,3,2]  
> Explanation:  
> The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].  
> - 00 and 01 differ by one bit  
> - 01 and 11 differ by one bit  
> - 11 and 10 differ by one bit  
> - 10 and 00 differ by one bit  
> [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].  
> - 00 and 10 differ by one bit  
> - 10 and 11 differ by one bit  
> - 11 and 01 differ by one bit  
> - 01 and 00 differ by one bit  

**Example 2**

> Input: n = 1  
> Output: [0,1]


**Constraints**

- 1 <= n <= 16

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def grayCode(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        if n == 0:
            return [0]
        t = self.grayCode(n-1)
        return t + [i + (1<<(n-1)) for i in t[::-1]]
```

**Notes**

- `>>` and `<<` are bitwise operators: `x << y` returns x with the bits **shifted** to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by `2**y`. 
- `x & y` does a "bitwise and". Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it's 0.
- `x | y` does a "bitwise or". Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it's 1.
- The idea is to use recursion, if we have gray code for `n-1`, than we can construct gray code for `n` easily. Imagine, that n = 4 and we have code `[0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4]`. Then we need to add numbers in `[8, 15]`. Let us add 8 to each number, so we have `[8, 9, 11, 10, 14, 15, 13, 12]` which is also code with property that every two adjacent number differ by one bit. All we need to do is to concatenate these two lists, but first we need to invert one of them to get `[0,1,3,2,6,7,5,4,12,13,15,14,10,11,9,8]` (copied from [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/discuss/1308570/Python-Short-recursive-solution-explained)).


**96. Unique Binary Search Trees**

Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique **BST**'s (_binary search trees_) which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`.
