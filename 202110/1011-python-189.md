**189. Rotate Array (Medium)**

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Follow up**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
- 
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        k = k % n
        nums[:] = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]
```

_I just realized I have solved this problem before..._

**204. Count Primes**

Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:

        if n < 3:
            return 0
        
        primes = [True] * n
        
        primes[0] = primes[1] = False
        
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if primes[i]:
                primes[i * i: n: i] = [False] * len(primes[i * i: n: i])
                
        return sum(primes)
```

```python
# improved version
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n < 2:
            return 0
        s = [1] * n
        s[0] = s[1] = 0
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if s[i] == 1:
                s[i*i : n : i] = [0] * len(s[i * i:n:i])
        return sum(s) 
```

**Note**

- The key idea of this solution is: 
    - for a random number `x`, `x*2` and the following higher times `x*3, x*4 ...` are absolutely not prime number.
    - instead of searching all `n`, we actually only need to look at the first `sqrt(n)`
    - `s[i*i : n : i] = [0] * len(s[i * i:n:i])` actually could be modified as `s[i*2 : n : i] = [0] * len(s[i * 2 : n : i])`, but the first one is faster. Similarly if we use `1/0` instead of `True/False` the runtime would be faster as well.
