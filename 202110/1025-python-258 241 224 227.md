**Solution**

```python
# my solution, slow
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        l = len(str(num))
        
        while l > 1:
            num = sum([int(i) for i in str(num)])
            l = len(str(num))
            
        return num
```

```python
# improved version
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        while num > 9:
            num = sum([int(i) for i in str(num)])
        return num
```


**241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses (medium)**

Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return _all possible results_ from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def diffWaysToCompute(self, input: str) -> List[int]:
        m = {}
        return self.dfs(input, m)
    
    def dfs(self, input, m):
        if input in m:
            return m[input]
        if input.isdigit():
            m[input] = int(input)
            return [int(input)]
        rlt = []
        for i, j in enumerate(input):
            if j in '+-*':
                l = self.diffWaysToCompute(input[:i])
                r = self.diffWaysToCompute(input[i+1:])
                rlt.extend(eval(str(x)+j+str(y)) for x in l for y in r)
        m[input] = rlt
        return rlt
```

```python
# improved version, faster
class Solution:
    def diffWaysToCompute(self, input, memo={}):
        """
        :type input: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if input.isdigit():
            return [int(input)]
        if input in memo:
            return memo[input] 
        res = []
        for i in range(len(input)):
            if input[i] in "-+*":
                res1 = self.diffWaysToCompute(input[:i])
                res2 = self.diffWaysToCompute(input[i+1:])
                for j in res1:
                    for k in res2:
                        res.append(self.helper(j, k, input[i]))
        memo[input] = res
        return res

    def helper(self, m, n, op):
        if op == "+":
            return m+n
        elif op == "-":
            return m-n
        else:
            return m*n   
```            

**Note**

- `string.isdigit()`: returns `True` if all the characters in `string` are digits, otherwise `False`. Exponents, like `Â²`, are also considered to be a digit.
- If `m` is a dict, then `if 'key1' in m:` detect whether `key1` is a key in `m`
- The key is we used `recursive` function. Everytime we meet a operator `+, -, *`, we will apply the function itself to the left and right part regarding that operator and then re-evaluate them. When we are evaluating an expression, there are 3 situations:
    - the expression is exactly a number -> no need to do compuation
    - the expression has shown before -> call back its corresponding value 
    - the expression is new -> need to do some computation

Because of the second situation, we defined the dictionaries `m`/`memo` to save the known expressions and their values.
- After testing, I did find the `eval` is slow, although it's a really handy function.



**224. Basic Calculator**

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Solution**

```python

```

**Note**

- Remember we use  `list.append()` or `list.extend()` to attach one or more elements to a list, and use `X += a` to add `a` to `X`. We could also use `list += a ,` to add `a` to the end of the `list`, but notice we put the comma `,` in the end.  
- `(1, -1)[c == '-']` explanation: `(1, -1)` is a tuple, `[c=='-']` is this tuple's index. Here the index value is only 0 or 1.
- `continue` statement in python can be used in both while and for loops. The continue statement in Python returns the control to the **beginning** of the while loop. The continue statement **rejects** all the **remaining** statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.
- We didn't care about the ` `(blank spaces) here, because the several `if` stataements will help us filter the blanks and handle those meaningful strings for us.
- The key ideas of this problem is 
    - Using `stack` to store the signs (1 (positive) or -1 (negative))
    - Every number consumes a sign, so we will pop out the last item in stack
    - Here is a more detailed explanation, [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/discuss/62344/Easy-18-lines-C%2B%2B-16-lines-Python).

_I strongly believe I need more time to digest and absorb this problem, please refer to the link above if needed._



**227. Basic Calculator II (medium)**

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Constraints**

- 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5  
- s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '\*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.  
- s represents a valid expression.  
- All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range \[0, 2^31 - 1].  
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.  

**Solution**

```python
# someone's method, not mine
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s):
        total = 0
        outer = iter(['+'] + re.split('([+-])', s))
        for addsub in outer:
            inner = iter(['*'] + re.split('([*/])', next(outer)))
            term = 1
            for muldiv in inner:
                n = int(next(inner))
                term = term*n if muldiv == '*' else term//n
            total += term if addsub == '+' else -term
        return total 
```

**Note**

- `iter()`: creates an object which can be iterated one element at a time. The syntax is as below. 
> iter(object, sentinel)  
The `object` is used to create the iterator, and `sentinel` is the special value that is used to represent the end of a sequence. Eg:
```python
# list of vowels
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
vowels_iter = iter(vowels)

print(next(vowels_iter))    # 'a'
print(next(vowels_iter))    # 'e'
print(next(vowels_iter))    # 'i'
print(next(vowels_iter))    # 'o'
print(next(vowels_iter))    # 'u'

# output
a
e
i
o
u
```

- `re`: Regular expression operations. `re.split(pattern, str)`: Split the string by each occurrence of the pattern. `re.split(pattern, str, maxsplit=2)`: Split the string by the occurrences of the pattern. Limit the number of splits to 2. Check [here](https://pynative.com/python-regex-split/).
