**171. Excel Sheet Column Number**

Given a string columnTitle that represents the column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number. 

For example:  
```
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
```

**Constraints**

- 1 <= columnTitle.length <= 7
- columnTitle consists only of uppercase English letters.
- columnTitle is in the range \["A", "FXSHRXW"].

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def titleToNumber(self, columnTitle: str) -> int:
        dic = {
            'A':1 ,
            'B':2 ,
            'C':3 ,
            'D':4 ,
            'E':5 ,
            'F':6 ,
            'G':7 ,
            'H':8 ,
            'I':9 ,
            'J':10,
            'K':11,
            'L':12,
            'M':13,
            'N':14,
            'O':15,
            'P':16,
            'Q':17,
            'R':18,
            'S':19,
            'T':20,
            'U':21,
            'V':22,
            'W':23,
            'X':24,
            'Y':25,
            'Z':26
        }
        s = 0
        for i in range(-1, -len(columnTitle)-1, -1):
            s += dic[columnTitle[i]] * 26**abs(i+1)
            
        return s
```

```python
# improved version
class Solution:
    def titleToNumber(self, columnTitle: str) -> int:
        # chr(65): A. A-Z's unicode are 65-90
        dic = {chr(i+65):i+1 for i in range(26)}
        s = 0
        for i in range(-1, -len(columnTitle)-1, -1):
            s += dic[columnTitle[i]] * 26**abs(i+1)
            
        return s
```

**Notes**

- A-Z's unicode are 65-90.


**172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes**

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

Note that `n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`.

**Constraints**

- 0 <= n <= 10^4

**Solutions**

```python
class Solution:
    def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        fac = factorial(n)
        fac2 = str(fac)
        l = len(fac2)
        fac3 = fac2.rstrip('0')
        l2 = len(fac3)
        return l - l2
```

**Note**

- Since it doesn't forbid using `factorial` so it's faily easy here.


**189. Rotate Array**

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.  
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?  


**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        k = k % n
        nums[:] = nums[n-k:] + nums[:n-k]
```

**Note**

- We don't need to return anything here. Instead, we need to make changes upon our object `nums` directly. Thus we need to ensure the object `nums` would be changed. Thus we have `nums[:] = ...` here. I tried `nums = ...` but failed, althought I am not sure what happened here... I guess this is something related to the `aliasing` of list. By using `num[:]` we are actually naming/cloning an object called `nums`.
