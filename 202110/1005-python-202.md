**202. Happy Number**

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
         mem = set()
         while n != 1:
             n = sum([int(i)**2 for i in str(n)])
             if n in mem:
                 return False
             else:
                 mem.add(n)
               
         else:
             return True
```

```python
# improved version
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = sum([int(x) **2 for x in str(n)])
        return n == 1
```

**Note**

- `set.add()` works like `list.append()`
