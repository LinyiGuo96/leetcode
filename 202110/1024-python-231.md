**231. Power of Two**

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that `n == 2^x`.

**Constraints**

- -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

_Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?_

**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n == 0:
            return False
        else:
            return n > 0 and not(n&(n-1))
```

**Note**

- Remember that `&` is a bitwise AND operator. If integer `n` is 4, then its bitwise expression is `100`. Output of `100000 & 011111` is `000000`, that is `0`. 
- If one integer is the power of 2, then its bitwise expression begins with `1` and following by `0`s.
