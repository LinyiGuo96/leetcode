**223. Rectangle Area**

Given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(ax1, ay1)` and its **top-right** corner `(ax2, ay2)`.

The second rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(bx1, by1)` and its **top-right** corner `(bx2, by2)`.
