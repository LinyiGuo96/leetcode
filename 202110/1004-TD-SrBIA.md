**1. Logistic regression requirement**

Q: First, binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary and ordinal logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal. Second, logistic regression requires the observations to be independent of each other.  In other words, the observations should not come from repeated measurements or matched data. Third, logistic regression requires there to be little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables. This means that the independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other. Fourth, logistic regression assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds. Finally, logistic regression typically requires a large sample size. 

A similar question would be **Linear regression requirement**: First, linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear. Secondly, the linear regression analysis requires all variables to be multivariate normal. Thirdly, linear regression assumes that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.  

**2. How to get two different point in the ROC curve (How to plot ROC curve?)**

Q: It depends on the threshold we take to classify the prediction. This [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-roc-curve-in-three-visual-steps-795b1399481c) might be helpful.

**3. When detecting fradud, if one model have an accuracy at 90%, whether it's good or not?**

Q: Not good. Because the rate of fraud is very low, so even for a very simple model, it could possibly have an accuracy at 90%.

**4. A case study**

When get some data, perhaps making a strategy is the first thing you need to do, such as what we are going to do with these data. Do NOT work on the data without thinking.


**In the end**

Although this is a really good opportunity, it finally turns out I am not qualified enough I guess. But failures are always good (as long as you don't fail all the time...), because you can always learn something from them and they are usually unforgettable. Cheers! Wish me luck!
