**268. Missing Number**

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range \[0, n], return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array_.

**Solution**

```python
# my method, slow
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums)+1):
            if i in nums:
                pass
            else:
                return i
```

```python
# very 'math' method
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        # we need to use `//` below instead of `/` to avoid float number
        return n * (n+1) // 2 - sum(nums) 
```

**Note**

- Sum of `0...n` minus sum of the given numbers is the missing one.



**279. Perfect Squares**

Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.
