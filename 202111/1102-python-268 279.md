**268. Missing Number**

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range \[0, n], return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array_.

**Solution**

```python
# my method, slow
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums)+1):
            if i in nums:
                pass
            else:
                return i
```

```python
# very 'math' method
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        # we need to use `//` below instead of `/` to avoid float number
        return n * (n+1) // 2 - sum(nums) 
```

**Note**

- Sum of `0...n` minus sum of the given numbers is the missing one.



**279. Perfect Squares**

Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

**Solution**

```python
# Method based on pure math
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        if int(sqrt(n))**2 == n: 
            return 1
        
        for j in range(int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if int(sqrt(n-j*j)) == sqrt(n-j*j):
                return 2
            
        while n % 4 == 0:
            n >>= 2
        if n % 8 == 7:
            return 4
        
        return 3
```

**Note**

- _Lagrange's four-square theorem_: also known as _Bachet's conjecture_, states that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares. That is, the squares form an additive basis of order four.
- Here is a detailed explanation: 
    1. The Lagrange's four-square theorem sets the upper bound for the results of the problem, i.e. if the number n cannot be decomposed into a fewer number of squares, at least it can be decomposed into the sum of 4 square numbers
    2. However, Lagrange's four-square theorem does not tell us directly the least numbers of square to decompose a natural number. Later, in 1797, Adrien-Marie Legendre completed the four-square theorem with his three-square theorem, by proving a particular condition that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three squares:

    3. Therefore, we know if n = 4^k(8m+7) then it can only be represented by 4 integer squares. 
    4. And it's not hard to detect whether number `n` itself is a perfect square or a sum of two perfect squares. 
    5. As for the situation of 3 squares, we could save it in the end, therefore we don't need to detect it directly.
    
- Here is the algo:
    - check `n` is a squared integer or not
    - check `n` is the sum of two squared integers or not
    - check `n == 4^k(8m+7)` or not
    - If no `return` in last 3 steps, return `3`
