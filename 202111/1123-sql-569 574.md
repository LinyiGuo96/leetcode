_Follow up: Could you solve it without using any built-in or window functions?_


**Solution**

```mysql
select tmp.id, tmp.company, tmp.salary
from (
    select *, row_number() over (partition by company order by salary, id) as rank_asc, 
    row_number() over (partition by company order by salary desc, id desc) as rank_des
    from employee
) tmp
where rank_asc = rank_des or rank_asc = rank_des - 1 or rank_asc = rank_des + 1; 
```


```sql
# CTE
with cte as (
    select *, row_number() over(partition by Company order by Salary) as row_num,
           count(Id) over(partition by Company) as cnt
    from Employee 
)

select id, company, salary
from cte
where row_num between cnt/2.0 and cnt/2.0 + 1;
```


**Note**

- `row_number()`: Unlike the RANK and DENSE_RANK functions, the ROW_NUMBER function simply returns the row number of the sorted records starting with 1. For example, if RANK and DENSE_RANK functions of the first two records in the ORDER BY column are equal, both of them are assigned 1 as their RANK and DENSE_RANK. However, the ROW_NUMBER function will assign values 1 and 2 to those rows without taking the fact that they are equally into account.
- For the last `where` clause, we can't use `where abs(rank_asc, rank_des)` directly, otherwise, we will get the error as following:

> BIGINT UNSIGNED value is out of range

- We _may_ (not sure) not be able to name a variable as `row`.
