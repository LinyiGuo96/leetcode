**263. Ugly Number**

An _ugly_ number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer n, return `true` if n is an **ugly number**.

**Constraints**

- -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

**Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        for i in 2,3,5:
            while n % i == 0 < n:
                n /= i
            
        return n == 1
```

**Note**

- `n % i == 0 < n`: this is the first time I saw the combination of `==` and `<`. Because `==`, `>`, `<` and etc, these operators are at the same level so when computing them we just need to follow the order from left to right. Here, we first check whether `n%i == 0` and then check whether `n%i < n`.
